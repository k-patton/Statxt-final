one

rejects

pleasure

itself
2
 
because
3
 
it

is
1
 
pleasure

but

because

those

who

do

not
1
 
know
1
 
how
1
 
to
1
 
pursue
2
 
pleasure
3
 
rationally
4
 
encounter
3
 
consequences
4
 
that
1
 
are
2
 
extremely
4
 
painful
2
 
nor

again

is

there

anyone

who

pursues

or

desires

to
1
 
obtain

pain
1
 
of

itself

because

it

is

pain

occasionally

circumstances
4
 
occur
2
 
in
1
 
which
1
 
toil
1
 
and
1
 
pain
1
 
can
1
 
procure
3
 
him
1
 
some
2
 
great
1
 
pleasure
3
 
to
1
 
take
2
 
a
1
 
trivial
2
 
example
3
 
which
1
 
of
1
 
us
1
 
ever
2
 
undertakes
4
 
laborious
3
 
physical
3
 
exercise
4
 
except
2
 
to
1
 
obtain
2
 
some
2
 
advantage
4
 
from
1
 
it
1
 
but
1
 
who
1
 
has
1
 
any
2
 
right
1
 
to
1
 
find
1
 
fault
1
 
with
1
 
a
1
 
man
1
 
who
1
 
chooses
2
 
to
1
 
enjoy
2
 
a
1
 
pleasure
3
 
that
1
 
has
1
 
no
1
 
annoying
2
 
consequences
4
 
or
1
 
one
2
 
who
1
 
avoids
2
 
a
1
 
pain
1
 
that
1
 
produces
3
 
no
1
 
resultant
3
 
pleasure
3
 
on
1
 
the
1
 
other
2
 
hand
1
 
we
1
 
denounce
3
 
with
1
 
righteous
2
 
indignation
4
 
and
1
 
dislike
3
 
men
1
 
who
1
 
are
2
 
so
1
 
beguiled
3
 
and
1
 
demoralized
5
 
by
1
 
the
1
 
charms
1
 
of
1
 
pleasure
3
 
of
1
 
the
1
 
moment
2
 
so
1
 
blinded
2
 
by
1
 
desire
3
 
that
1
 
they
1
 
cannot
2
 
foresee
3
 
the
1
 
pain
1
 
and
1
 
trouble
2
 
that
1
 
are
2
 
bound
1
 
to
1
 
ensue
2
 
and
1
 
equal
2
 
blame
2
 
belongs
2
 
to
1
 
those
2
 
who
1
 
fail
1
 
in
1
 
their
1
 
duty
2
 
through
1
 
weakness
2
 
of
1
 
will
1
 
which
1
 
is
1
 
the
1
 
same
2
 
as
1
 
saying
1
 
through
1
 
shrinking
2
 
from
1
 
toil
1
 
and
1
 
pain
1
 
these
2
 
cases
2
 
are
2
 
perfectly
3
 
simple
2
 
and
1
 
easy
2
 
to
1
 
distinguish
3
 
in
1
 
a
1
 
free
1
 
hour
1
 
when
1
 
our
1
 
power
2
 
of
1
 
choice
2
 
is
1
 
untrammeled
4
 
and
1
 
when
1
 
nothing
2
 
prevents
2
 
our
1
 
being
1
 
able
2
 
to
1
 
do
1
 
what
1
 
we
1
 
like
2
 
best
1
 
every
3
 
pleasure
3
 
is
1
 
to
1
 
be
1
 
welcomed
3
 
and
1
 
every
3
 
pain
1
 
avoided
3
 
but
1
 
in
1
 
certain
2
 
circumstances
4
 
and
1
 
owing
2
 
to
1
 
the
1
 
claims
1
 
of
1
 
duty
2
 
or
1
 
the
1
 
obligations
4
 
of
1
 
business
3
 
it
1
 
will
1
 
frequently
3
 
occur
2
 
that

pleasures

to
